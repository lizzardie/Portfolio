    <p>first project i want to document here is the luc in absentia study page progress. 
        i have a v1 with notes, wanna keep a copy at each stage so i can make a fun progress slide show thingy :3</p>
    <p>the idea is to have the final image centered in some part of the page and then below it a scrollable thing of each version before it</p>
